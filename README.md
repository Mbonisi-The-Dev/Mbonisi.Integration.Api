# Mbonisi.Integration.Api

C# Integration API to connect to Swapi Api and the Chucknorris Api that uses Swagger UI to expose the Integration API. 

This Integration API should be run concurrently with the Angular Single Page Application(SPA). 
My Angular SPA(reffered to as Mbonisi SPA - https://github.com/mbonisi287/MbonisiSPA) is what is consumed by the Angular SPA.

This is my integration Api which handles all the back end work to communicate with the Swapi and ChuckNorris Api
